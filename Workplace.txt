My workplace for programming DomWik:
- VS Code + extensions:
    - C# (for VS Code)                      [Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, Debugging]
    - NuGet Package Manager GUI             [obvious]
    - Mintlify Doc Writer                   [select function and press Ctrl+'.' (or click pop-up message 'Generate dox')]
    - auto-header                           [Ctrl+Alt+'I' to insert header block]
    - Better Comments                       [provides colors for comments started from particular symbol, see description below]
    - C# XML Documentation Comments         [type "///" for starting comment block]
    - Automatic Comment Blocks (yCodeTech)  [type "/**" for starting comment block]
    - ResXpress                             [previewer and reorganizer]
    - Markdownlint                          [highlight and check when editing of .md files]
    - GitGraph                              [visual representation of pull/push requests]

Extensions "Better Comments" has configured for next highlightings:
    - "!" - red (high priority issue)
    - "?" - orange (issue)
    - "x " - grey strikethrough (reject)
    - "+" - yellow (to be worked out)
    - "*" - light-green (attention/information)
    - "v " - bright-blue (approved, running)
